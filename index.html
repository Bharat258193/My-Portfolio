    </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      I first began writing because I had an intense fear of speaking in front of people.
      I learned to channel my emotions and thoughts onto paper and slowly this became a habit.
    </p>
</div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The habit turned into a passion as I was exposed to literature from around the world.
      I dreamt of writing like Rushdie, of filling pages after pages as Marquez did, and of
      writing a city in words like Rohinton Mistry's. Not a very realistic dream I eventually
      realized, but a dream nonetheless.
    </p>
</div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      From the world of dreams to the real, I have written content for various brands and worked
      across domains. Beginning as a technical writer and customer solutions executive at
      The Higher Pitch, I eventually ended up as a Content Marketing Manager at Cadabams Group.
      Along the way, I have scripted videos for multiple brands, done social media copywriting
      for the Bangalore Poetry Festival, and worked as a production executive for an Estonian
      short film as well.
    </p>
</div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Throughout this journey, writing has always remained something I indulge in to nourish
      myself. So, when I am happy, I write, when I am sad, I write, and when I feel awkward,
      I write a little more.
